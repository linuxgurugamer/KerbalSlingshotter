	Thanks to forum user @Wyzard256 for the following:
		Tracking station performance fix
		Simplify code in TrackingSlingshot.CurrentVessel() a little

		Cache the SpaceTracking lookup, since it's slow

		Unity's FindObjectOfType method is slow, and calling it every UI frame
		(from WindowGUI) has a major performance impact.  Since it's being used
		to look up an object that's always the same for the lifetime of the
		scene, we can do the lookup just once in Start() and save it in a field.

		This resolves the laggy game UI when the Slingshotter window is open.

		Make SlingshotCore.CurrentVessel() an abstract method

		Getting the current vessel is done differently depending on whether the
		player is in the flight scene or tracking station, and CurrentVessel()
		was a static method that would check HighLogic.LoadedScene to decide
		what to do.  But there are already separate derived classes for the two
		scenes, so the same thing can be accomplished with an abstract method
		that's implemented differently in those two classes.  This avoids the
		need to check HighLogic.LoadedScene when the calling object already
		knows what scene it's in.

		Remove "vessel" property to avoid repeated calls to CurrentVessel()

		SlingshotCore.FixedUpdate refers to "vessel" in a bunch of places, and
		that was actually a property whose getter was a call to CurrentVessel().
		That's a somewhat expensive operation, especially in the tracking
		station (where it involves a call to FindObjectOfType(), which Unity
		documents as "very slow" and not to be used every frame), so the
		multiple "vessel" accesses made the UI very laggy when a vessel was
		selected in the tracking station.

		To avoid calling CurrentVessel() so often, I've removed the "vessel"
		property and replaced it with a local variable in each method that needs
		it, initialized with a single up-front call to CurrentVessel().  This
		still isn't ideal (since it still calls FindObjectOfType() at least once
		per FixedUpdate), but it's a simple change that provides a significant
		performance improvement when a vessel is selected in the tracking
		station.
